So at the time of writing my last post, the round of 32 had ended and the tournament was heading into the sweet sixteen. At that point, my bracket was in the 99.4 percentile, and unfortunately, that isn’t the case anymore. My model definitely had some misses, and my human errors also cost me, but in some cases they actually helped. So lets pick things up at the sweet sixteen for each region and see where I went wrong.</description>

      <description>Alright folks, here we are. The first of (hopefully) many blog posts, and this one is on a project that has been an absolute blast. For my Advanced Sports Data course, my professor gave us the assignment of using our choice of various machine learning methods to create a model to predict the outcome of men’s college basketball games based on prior data, and use that model to attempt to find the results of the NCAA tournament this year.</description>

      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Branden.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Junior student in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Sports Media and Communications, with minors in Statistics and Mathematics in an attempt to make my own sort of &amp;ldquo;path&amp;rdquo; for studying Sports Data Analytics. Sports have always been a huge part of my life, whether it was playing or watching them, and when I decided that Computer Engineering wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be the career for me after one semester of classes, being able to apply my knowledge of code and computers in a field that actually interested me was too much to pass up.</description>
