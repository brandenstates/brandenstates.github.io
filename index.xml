      <description>Alright folks, here we are. The first of (hopefully) many blog posts, and this one is on a project that has been an absolute blast.

Sports have always been a huge part of my life, whether it was playing or watching them, and when I decided that Computer Engineering wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be the career for me after one semester of classes, being able to apply my knowledge of code and computers in a field that actually interested me was too much to pass up.</description>
